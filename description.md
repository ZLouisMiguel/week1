│── styles.css    # CSS file for styling and layout

### Description of Each File

- **`index.html`** — The main entry point for the webpage. Defines the structure and content that appears in the browser.  
- **`styles.css`** — Controls how the HTML elements look (colors, fonts, spacing, layout).  
- **`script.js`** — Adds logic and interactivity, such as animations or background color changes.  
- **`assets/`** — Stores media files like images, icons, or background graphics. Keeping these in one folder keeps your project tidy.

  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Web</h1>
    <p>The first webpage</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
 ```
